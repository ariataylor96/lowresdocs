User-added commands in LRN's framework have a decent number of distinct properties. Fortunately, managing all of these is pretty easy! There is a system command for every aspect of them. We've got:

 - [Adding a new command](./add)
 - [Adding an alias to an existing command](./alias)
 - [Editing a command](./edit)
 - [Deleting a command](./delete)
 - [Changing the permissions of a command](./permissions)
 - [Changing the cooldown of a command](./cooldown)

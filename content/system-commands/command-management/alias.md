title: Aliasing
---

# Usage

```
!addalias <commandname> <alias1[, alias2[, alias3, [...aliasN]]]>
```

# Description

Adds an alias to an existing command. An alias is just a new name that can be used for that command, so you can have multiple options that all point to the same thing.

This command can add as many aliases as you want in a single call, as long as it fits inside the Twitch message length limit.

Anywhere a command name is used, an alias for it can be used as well.

# Examples

```
!addalias discord discordserver
!addalias lurk lurking goingtolurk byebye
!addalias ban banned nope leave
```

# Aliases

 - `!newalias`
 - `!alias`

# Permissions Level

VIP and above (`1`)

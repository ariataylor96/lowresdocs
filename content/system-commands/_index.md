System commands are defined in LRN's code and cannot be modified by other commands. These are typically restricted to VIPs, moderators, or just Nickel. They also do not show up in the [commands list](https://commands.exotichorse.com/lowresnickel). Because of their static nature, they'll be listed here in the documentation.

They can be broken down into a few different groups:

 - [Command Management](./command-management/)
 - [Cats-a-log](./catsalog/)
 - [Memes](./memes/)
 - [Quotes](./quotes/)
 - [Pronouns](./pronouns/)
 - [ShoutOut](./shout-out/)
